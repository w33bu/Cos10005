<aside>
<p>During the legendary Hung Kings period, Hung Yen belonged to Giao Chi, in Du Chien district. Under the Ngo dynasty, it was called Dang Chau. It was then renamed Thai Binh phủ (phủ is an administrative unit) under the Early Lê dynasty, Dang Chau and Khoai Chau phủ under the Lý dynasty and Long Hung lo (lo is an administrative unit) and Khoai lo under the Trần Dynasty. Under the Later Lê dynasty, Hung Yen belonged to Son Nam and then divided into Sơn Nam Thuong lo and Son Nam Ha lo. This area has favourable transport conditions with communes and markets lying side by side, enabling trading activities to be busier and busier. The Chronicle of Hưng Yên Province stated: "The streets are very busy and bustle, crowded with vehicles; the old images of Phổ Hiền in Sơn Nam can be seen now in this land". Nowaday, the red river has changed it's current, disable the trading capacity of Hung Yen.</p>
